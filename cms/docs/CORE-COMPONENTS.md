When all from ./FRONTEND-PLAN.md is done and set, we can start with core elements using/tweaking shadcn components.
I would like to have in place these responsive components:
- header with menu items and mobile menu for small devices
- footer
- layout container with padding and max-width from config
- login form
- sign in form
- forgotten password form
